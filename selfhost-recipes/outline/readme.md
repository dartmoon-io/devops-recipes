# Outline (aka Brain)

# Installation
Simply feed the `docker-compose.yml` to Portainer and define all the environment variables that you will find inside the `.env` file.

# S3 Bucket
Outline need a special configuration of the S3 bucket. Inside the `cors.json` you will find this configuration, so you just need to tweak the domain name and then configure your bucket. This is a provider-dependant configuratio so follow the documentation of your provider.
