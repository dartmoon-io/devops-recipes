# Dartmoon Devops Recipes
This is a collection of recipes we use. We'll keep this repo updated, so stay tuned for more!

## Docker recipes
Inside this folder you'll find our Docker recipes for some development environments we use internally. They are **not** production ready and should never be used in production. To use Docker in production DYOR (Do Your Own Reserach).

## Drone recipes
We use [Drone CI](https://www.drone.io/) for automatic deployment and testing. In this folder we collected  some of the recipes we use with all the related files.

## Selfhost recipes
We love to use [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) to maintain our selfhost software inside our cluster nodes. Here is a collection of Docker compose stacks, ready to be deployed! If you want to use them remember to secure your nodes (and define a good backup policy)!

Enjoy!
